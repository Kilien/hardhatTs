# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

### Command-line completion

This package, hardhat-shorthand, installs a globally accessible binary called hh that runs your locally installed hardhat.

```shell
npm install --global hardhat-shorthand
```

### add .env file
```shell
PRIVATE_KEY = 'xxxx' // user private key
ARBKey = 'xxxx' // arb verify API key
```
